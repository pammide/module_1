# Terraform Sample Workshop Module 1

In this module you will learn what is Terraform and also learn the basic of how to code a sample **.tf** file to create a stack, it will teach you the basics of Terraform and how to code a simple architecture using Terraform resources.

# What is Terraform?

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services. Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files.

Write infrastructure as code using declarative configuration files. HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) allows for concise descriptions of resources using blocks, arguments, and expressions.

# Folder structure

```
 ── one_file_tf
    └── simple_nginx_stack
        ├── data.tf
        ├── files
        │   └── install_nginx.sh
        ├── main.tf
        ├── outputs.tf
        └── vars.tf
```

[data.tf](one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/data.tf) - This is the Data sources file, Data Sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use elsewhere in Terraform configuration. Use of data sources allows a Terraform configuration to make use of information defined outside of Terraform, or defined by another separate Terraform configuration.

[files/install_nginx.sh](one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/files/install_nginx.sh) - This is the shell script that we are going to pass to our code as the User Data of our EC2 that will be provisioned.

[main.tf](one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/main.tf) - This is the file is where resources lives, resources are the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.

[outputs.tf](one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/outputs.tf) - Here is where you create the outputs, output values are like the return values of a Terraform module, you can use this outputs for reference later.

[vars.tf](one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/vars.tf) - This file contains all variables that we pass to our resources to create, input variables serve as parameters for a Terraform module, allowing aspects of the module to be customized without altering the module's own source code, and allowing modules to be shared between different configurations.

It's recommended that you open all the above files and check them to get a better understanding how Terraform works.

For more information consult the [Official Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html)

# Deploying our first stack

We are going to deploy our first stack using a simple **one file snippet** of Terraform with all the resources that we will need to provision.

<p align="center"> 
<img src="images/one_file_tf.png">
</p>


**ALL THE COMMANDS WILL NEED TO BE RUN INSIDE one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/**

Execute:

```shell
cd one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/
```

Now we need to change the **AWS Bucket** where out Terraform State will be saved. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.

If you don't have a bucket in AWS create one, [How to Create AWS Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)

Open **one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/main.tf** and do the following:

```terraform
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    region  = "us-east-1"
    bucket  = "<YOUR BUCKET NAME GOES HERE>"
    key     = "terraform/one_file_tf/simple_nginx_stack/main.tf"
    encrypt = true
  }
}
```
Now it's time to init our Terraform, init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.

Execute:

```shell
terraform init
```

<p align="center"> 
<img src="images/terraform_init.png">
</p>

Now we are going to create our SSH key and import to AWS, this key we can use to access our EC2 provisioned by Terraform.

Execute:

```
scripts/generate_ssh_key.sh
```

The output should be the follow:

```
Key imported!
```

Let's execute **terraform validate** command validates the configuration files in a directory, referring only to the configuration and not accessing any remote services such as remote state, provider APIs, etc.

Execute:

```shell
terraform validate
```

<p align="left"> 
<img src="images/terraform_validate.png">
</p>

Now it's time for **terraform plan**

The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.

This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state. For example, terraform plan might be run before committing a change to version control, to create confidence that it will behave as expected.

Execute:

```
terraform plan
```

The output will be the resources that we are going to provision or change during the terraform apply phase.

<p align="left"> 
<img src="images/terraform_plan.png">
</p>

Now let's apply our Terraform

The **terraform apply** command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.

Execute:

```
terraform apply
```

When ask to confirm if you want to apply, type **yes**

Wait some minutes to apply and the creation of resources.

The Output should be the follow:

<p align="left"> 
<img src="images/terraform_apply.png">
</p>

Now it's time to test, wait for 2 or 3 minutes before trying to open the Load Balancer DNS generated above.

If everything works fine you will see the nginx web page.

<p align="left"> 
<img src="images/nginx_page.png">
</p>

Now it's time to destroy our stack using **terraform destroy** command

The terraform destroy command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

Execute:

```
terraform destroy
```

When ask to confirm if you want to destroy, type **yes**

The Output should be the follow:

<p align="left"> 
<img src="images/terraform_destroy.png">
</p>

As you can see, this command destroy all the resources that we provisioned before.
